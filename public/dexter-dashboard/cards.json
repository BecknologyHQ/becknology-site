    "body": "In Q4 2025, North American companies ordered 10,325 industrial robots worth $579 million. That is a 6.6% jump from the year before.\n\nAutomotive led the surge. Major vehicle manufacturers are finally stabilizing after years of supply chain chaos. But here is the twist -- non-automotive orders are growing even faster. Food, pharma, logistics. Everyone wants robots now.\n\nThe companies building these machines? Fanuc (FANUY), ABB, Rockwell (ROK). They are not guessing about demand. They are filling orders.\n\nRobot density in the US is still half of South Korea's. We are early.",

A filler valve opens for exactly 0.12 seconds, dispensing the precise volume. Then a lid is placed and seamed shut with two mechanical rolls -- one tucks the edge, the second crimps it airtight. The whole seal takes 0.08 seconds.\n\nEvery can gets hit with a camera inspection system checking fill level, lid placement, and date code. One bad can and the whole batch gets flagged.\n\nBall Corporation makes most of the cans. Ticker BALL. $14 billion company built on a piece of aluminum thinner than a credit card.",
