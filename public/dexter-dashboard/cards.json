    "body": "The Dyson Airwrap is a $600 hair tool. The reason it costs 10x more than a normal curling iron has nothing to do with hair. It's because of a motor smaller than a quarter spinning at 110,000 revolutions per minute.\n\nFor context: a Formula 1 engine redlines at 15,000 RPM. A jet turbine runs around 25,000 RPM. This motor in the handle of a hair styling tool spins 4x faster than a jet engine.\n\nIt's called the Dyson V9 digital motor. It uses a switched reluctance design -- no permanent magnets, no brushes, just precisely timed electromagnetic pulses flipping a rotor at absurd speed. The impeller attached to that rotor sucks air in and accelerates it around the barrel. Hair wraps itself around the barrel using the Coanda effect -- the same physics that keeps airplane wings generating lift.\n\nDyson spent $350 million developing this motor. They built an entire motor factory in Singapore and another in the Philippines. Over 100 million Dyson digital motors have been manufactured. Each one is balanced to within 0.002 grams because at 110,000 RPM, a speck of dust on the impeller creates enough vibration to destroy the bearings.\n\nThe motor runs on a 13-blade impeller machined from a single piece of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) -- a space-grade polymer that costs $200/kg. Each blade is angled to within 0.1 degrees.\n\nDyson is private so there's no ticker. But they pull in $7.7 billion in revenue annually. James Dyson is worth $29 billion. All from a guy who built 5,127 failed vacuum prototypes in his garage before getting one right.",

    "ticker": ["BALL"],
    "body": "Liquid Death, Monster, Celsius, Coca-Cola -- they're all just water or chemicals inside the same object: an aluminum can. And the way that can is made is one of the most insane manufacturing processes on Earth.\n\nIt starts as a flat aluminum disc called a blank, punched from a sheet of aluminum alloy 3104 (aluminum + manganese + magnesium). A cupping press slams a punch through the blank at 60 mph, forming a shallow cup. Then the cup enters a bodymaker machine where a ram drives it through three progressively tighter steel rings. Each ring thins the aluminum wall further. The walls go from 0.3mm thick to 0.1mm -- thinner than a human hair. This is called wall ironing.\n\nThe entire forming process -- from flat disc to finished can body -- takes 0.2 seconds. One machine produces 2,400 cans per minute. A single factory runs 12-20 of these machines. Ball Corporation's largest plants produce over 10 billion cans per year.\n\nBut here's the part nobody talks about: the inside of every aluminum can is coated with a thin layer of epoxy resin. Without it, the acid in soda would dissolve through the aluminum wall in 3 days. That epoxy lining has been controversial because older formulations contained BPA. Most manufacturers switched to non-BPA coatings, but the replacements (BPS, BPAF) may have similar health concerns.\n\nThe can lid is even more complex. The tab mechanism is a second-class lever with a rivet, a scored panel, and precisely calculated break points. It took 5 years and 200 patents to develop. The person who invented the stay-on-tab -- Daniel Cudzik at Reynolds Metals -- created what's considered one of the top 10 mechanical inventions of the 20th century.\n\nBall Corporation (BALL) makes roughly 1 out of every 4 cans on Earth. $14 billion revenue. Their stock has 10x'd since 2009.",

    "body": "SHEIN isn't a clothing company. It's a real-time demand prediction engine that happens to sell clothes.\n\nHere's how it actually works: SHEIN's AI scrapes social media, Google Trends, and competitor sites to identify what styles, colors, and patterns are gaining momentum RIGHT NOW. The algorithm generates design briefs automatically. Human designers finalize the patterns, but the trend identification is entirely machine-driven.\n\nWhen a new design is approved, SHEIN orders an initial batch of just 100-200 units. Not thousands. Not millions. A tiny test batch. The garment goes from concept to listing on the app in 7-14 days. Zara takes 3-4 weeks. H&M takes 4-6 months. Traditional retailers take 12-18 months.\n\nOnce listed, SHEIN's algorithm watches the real-time data: clicks, cart adds, purchases, returns, time spent viewing. If a design hits, automated reorders scale production to thousands within 48 hours. If it flops, the SKU dies quietly. No markdowns. No warehouse of unsold inventory.\n\nSHEIN works with over 5,400 suppliers, almost all within a 5-hour drive of their Guangzhou headquarters. Suppliers get demand forecasts updated in real time through SHEIN's proprietary software. Many factories keep dedicated SHEIN production lines that can switch patterns in under an hour.\n\nThe numbers are staggering: 7,000+ new SKUs added daily. 1.5 million active SKUs at any time. $45 billion in revenue in 2024. All from a company that owns zero factories. SHEIN doesn't manufacture a single garment -- they're a software platform that coordinates thousands of small workshops.\n\nSHEIN filed for a London IPO in 2024 at a $50 billion valuation. It's been delayed by regulatory scrutiny, but if it lists, it would be the biggest fashion IPO in history.",

    "type": "tiktok",
    "ticker": ["LULU"],
    "body": "Lululemon Align leggings cost $98. A comparable pair from Amazon costs $22. The difference is a proprietary fabric called Nulu and the way it's manufactured.\n\nNulu is made from nylon 6,6 -- a synthetic polymer first invented by DuPont in 1935. The nylon starts as a liquid chemical compound that gets extruded through a spinneret -- a showerhead-like plate with hundreds of microscopic holes. Each hole produces a single filament thinner than a spider's silk strand. These filaments are immediately cooled by a blast of air and wound onto bobbins at 3,000+ meters per minute.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: the filaments are then drawn -- heated and stretched to roughly 4x their original length. This aligns the polymer chains inside the fiber, giving it strength and elasticity. The degree of draw determines whether the fiber feels stiff or buttery. Lululemon specifies an exact draw ratio that their fabric mills guard as trade secrets.\n\nAfter knitting the fibers into fabric on circular knitting machines, the Nulu fabric goes through a finishing process called napping. Rotating drums covered in fine wire needles -- about 2,000 per square inch -- lightly scratch the surface of the fabric, pulling up microscopic fiber loops. This creates the \"naked\" sensation Lululemon markets. Too much napping and the fabric pills. Too little and it feels plasticky.\n\nThe fabric is then dyed using a process that requires 100+ liters of water per kilogram of fabric, heated to 130 degrees Celsius under pressure to force dye molecules into the nylon structure.\n\nLululemon (LULU) does $10 billion in annual revenue. Gross margins are 58% -- meaning that $98 pair of leggings costs roughly $41 to make, including fabric, labor, and shipping from Vietnam or Cambodia. The Align pant alone is estimated to generate over $1 billion in annual sales.",

    "ticker": ["CELH", "PEP"],
    "body": "Celsius is the third best-selling energy drink in America behind Monster and Red Bull. But unlike those two, Celsius doesn't own a single factory. Every can is made by contract manufacturers -- co-packers who produce beverages for dozens of brands on the same lines.\n\nThe process works like this: Celsius sends its proprietary formula to a co-packer. The formula includes their MetaPlus blend -- green tea extract (EGCG), guarana seed extract, ginger root, and caffeine (200mg per can, same as two cups of coffee). The co-packer mixes the ingredients in industrial blending tanks holding 5,000-10,000 gallons each. The liquid is flash-pasteurized -- heated to 185F for 15 seconds to kill bacteria without cooking the ingredients -- then cooled rapidly.\n\nThe liquid gets pumped into a canning line running at 1,500-2,000 cans per minute. Each can is filled, sealed with a lid, and pressurized with nitrogen to maintain carbonation and structural integrity. The nitrogen is what makes the can feel firm even though the aluminum walls are thinner than a credit card. Without pressurization, you could crush the can between two fingers.\n\nCelsius was founded in 2004 and nearly died multiple times. They were a penny stock trading under $1 from 2007-2017. Revenue in 2018 was just $52 million. Then TikTok fitness culture exploded and Celsius became THE gym drink. Revenue hit $631M in 2022, then $1.4 billion in 2024.\n\nIn 2022, PepsiCo (PEP) invested $550 million for an 8.5% stake and became Celsius's exclusive distribution partner. That deal put Celsius in every gas station, gym, and grocery store in America overnight. Before Pepsi, Celsius was in 40,000 retail locations. Now it's in 200,000+.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) stock went from $1 in 2019 to $98 at its peak -- a 9,700% run. It's pulled back significantly, but the growth story is far from over.",

    "ticker": [],
    "body": "Squishmallows are the best-selling plush toy in the world. Over 500 million have been sold since 2017. And what makes them squishy is recycled plastic water bottles.\n\nThe filling is polyester fiber made from recycled PET plastic (the same plastic in soda bottles and water bottles). The bottles get collected, shredded into flakes, melted, and extruded into ultra-fine polyester fibers. These fibers are then treated with silicone coating to make them slippery -- that's what gives Squishmallows that marshmallow-soft feel instead of the lumpy stuffing in regular teddy bears. Each Squishmallow contains the equivalent of about 10-15 recycled plastic bottles depending on size.\n\nThe outer shell is spandex-polyester blend fabric, which gives it the stretch and snap-back that regular cotton plush toys don't have. The fabric is digitally printed with the character design, then laser-cut into pattern pieces. Workers hand-sew the pieces together, stuff them with the silicone-coated fiber using pneumatic stuffing machines that blast fiber into the shell at precise weights, then close the final seam.\n\nQuality control is obsessive: every Squishmallow is hand-squeezed by a worker to check firmness consistency. Too firm, they pull fiber out. Too soft, they add more. The target is a very specific compression ratio that Jazwares (the parent company, owned by Alleghany Capital, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary) has trademarked as part of their product identity.\n\nYes -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway indirectly owns Squishmallows. Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.6 billion in 2022. Alleghany owns Jazwares. Jazwares owns Kelly Toy, which created Squishmallows. The toy division did roughly $3 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nThere are over 2,000 unique Squishmallow characters. New drops create lines outside Five Below stores.
