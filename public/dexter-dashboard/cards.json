A ram slams it through a series of rings at high speed, stretching it taller and thinner with each pass. That's called drawing and ironing. The walls end up thinner than a human hair -- 0.097mm -- but can hold 90 PSI of pressure from the carbonation.\n\nThen it gets washed, dried, and printed with up to 6 colors in a single pass on a machine spinning 2,400 cans per minute. The inside gets sprayed with a food-safe coating so the soda never touches raw aluminum.\n\nAmerica makes 100 billion aluminum cans a year. That's one can per person per day. Ball Corporation (BALL) makes most of them -- $14 billion company, and their machines are why your drink costs $1 instead of $5.",

    "body": "Nike spent millions trying to automate shoe production. The robots lost.\n\nHere's the problem. A sneaker upper -- the flexible part your foot goes into -- is made of soft, stretchy, squishy fabric. Robots are great with rigid stuff. Metal, glass, circuit boards. But try picking up a floppy piece of knit fabric and placing it perfectly? Robots fumble it.\n\nNike partnered with Flex to build a high-tech factory in Mexico. The plan was tens of millions of shoes made by machines. They brought in equipment from electronics manufacturing -- pick-and-place robots, automated gluers.\n\nThe robots struggled. The factory needed 5,000 workers -- twice what they planned. By 2019 they shut it down.\n\nOne company, Grabit, cracked part of it. Their robots use static electricity -- electroadhesion -- to grip fabric. They assemble shoe uppers 20x faster than humans. But full automation? Still impossible. Your $180 Jordans are still mostly made by hand.",

It's chilled with dry ice to the exact temperature where it holds shape but doesn't crack. Then it hits a rotary molder -- a spinning drum with cookie-shaped cavities that stamps out perfect circles with that iconic Oreo pattern. Thousands per minute.\n\nTwo conveyors run side by side. One carries cookies face-up, one face-down. A machine called a sandwiching depositor squirts exactly 3 grams of cream onto the face-up cookies. Then the face-down cookies get flipped on top. Perfect sandwich. Every time.\n\nThe whole line runs so fast that one factory can produce 3 million Oreos per shift. If one cookie is 0.5mm too thick or the cream is off by a fraction of a gram, sensors catch it and kick it off the line.\n\nMondelez (MDLZ) runs this across 18 countries. $36 billion company built on one cookie.",

    "body": "Those $100 leggings you're wearing? They started as crude oil in a refinery.\n\nLululemon's signature fabric is called Luon -- 86% nylon, 14% Lycra. Nylon is a plastic. It begins as a petrochemical called adipic acid mixed with hexamethylenediamine. Those combine at 545 degrees Fahrenheit to form nylon 6,6 polymer. The molten polymer gets extruded through a spinneret -- a metal plate with holes thinner than a spider's silk -- into long continuous fibers.\n\nThose fibers get stretched to 4x their length to align the molecules. That stretching is what makes nylon strong, flexible, and moisture-wicking. Then the fibers are knit into fabric on circular knitting machines running 3,000 RPM with 3,000 needles working simultaneously.\n\nThe fabric ships from Taiwan to Vietnam, where CAD-guided laser cutters slice the patterns. Human workers sew them -- about 20 minutes per pair.\n\nFrom oil well to yoga class. A $50 billion company built on fancy plastic pants.",

Purified water gets blended with caffeine, taurine, green tea extract, guarana, and ginger root. The mix is heated to pasteurize it -- kill any bacteria -- then rapidly cooled so the ingredients don't break down.\n\nStep two: carbonation. CO2 gets forced into the liquid at 60 PSI in a sealed tank. The colder the liquid, the more CO2 dissolves. That's why they chill it to near-freezing first.\n\nStep three: the filler. Cans run through a rotary filler that fills 1,200 cans per minute. Each can gets exactly 12 oz -- a load cell weighs every single one. Too heavy or too light? Rejected.\n\nStep four: the seamer. A lid drops on and two rollers crimp it shut in 0.1 seconds. The seal has to hold 90 PSI or the can explodes on the shelf.\n\nCelsius (CELH) went from $0 to $1.3 billion in revenue in 5 years.

The glass gets dropped into a molten potassium salt bath at 750 degrees for hours. Smaller sodium ions in the glass swap with larger potassium ions. This jams the surface into compression -- like inflating a basketball inside a soccer ball. That compression is what makes it scratch-resistant.\n\nBut Ceramic Shield -- the stuff on recent iPhones -- goes further. Nano-crystalline ceramics are grown directly inside the glass matrix. Crystals harder than most metals, embedded in glass that bends.\n\nThen the testing starts. Machines drop steel balls on it from increasing heights. Tumble it with sandpaper. Press a Vickers diamond into the surface at measured force. Simulate a pocket full of keys rubbing 10,000 cycles. If it survives all that, it goes in your phone.\n\nCorning (GLW) has made the glass on every iPhone ever. $35 billion company hiding in your pocket.",
