    "body": "That red dust on your fingers? It didn't get there by accident.\n\nTakis start as masa -- corn flour and water -- pressed flat and cut into tiny tubes by a machine spinning at 800 RPM. Then they hit the fryer. 375 degrees. 60 seconds. Thousands at a time.\n\nBut the seasoning is the wild part. They tumble through a rotating drum while nozzles blast chili-lime powder from every angle. The drum spins so fast the coating bonds to every single fold. Miss one spot and you'd taste plain corn. That never happens.\n\nGRUMA, the company behind the tortilla machines that make this possible, does $5.2 billion a year. Most people have never heard of them.",

A hydraulic press punches it into a cup shape with 200 tons of force -- the same pressure as parking an RV on your thumbnail.\n\nThen a second cup gets pressed. The two cups are welded together with a vacuum sealed between them. That vacuum is why your ice lasts 11 hours. No air, no heat transfer.\n\nThe powder coating? Electrostatic spray. The cup gets electrically charged, paint particles get the opposite charge, and they literally fly onto the surface and stick. Every millimeter covered.\n\nStanley is owned by Stanley Black and Decker. Ticker SWK. Their stock is down 40% from highs while selling the most viral cup on the internet.",
